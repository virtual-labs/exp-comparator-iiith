A digital comparator or magnitude comparator is a hardware electronic device that takes two numbers as input in binary form and determines whether one number is greater than, less than or equal to the other number. Comparators are used in a central processing units (CPU) and microcontrollers. Examples of digital comparator include the CMOS 4063 and 4585 and the TTL 7485 and 74682-'89.
